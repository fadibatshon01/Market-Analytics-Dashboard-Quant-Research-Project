</div>

The model evaluates multiple signals together:

| Category | Example Checks | Effect |
|-----------|----------------|--------|
| **Trend** | Is price above both MA10 & MA30? Are MAs rising? | Determines momentum |
| **Risk** | Volatility < 30%? Are we near 52-week highs/lows? | Manages exposure |
| **Gaps** | Price gap > +3% or < -3% from last close? | Detects breakouts |
| **Momentum** | MA10 slope sustained for 3+ days? | Confirms trend direction |

> 🟢 **BUY:** strong uptrend + low volatility  
> 🔴 **SELL:** downtrend + high volatility  
> 🟡 **HOLD:** mixed signals or neutral volatility
